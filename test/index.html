        <p>To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers over their body, 
          especially their face. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of 
          objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents. 
        </p>
          
        <p>Domestic cats use many vocalisations for communication, including purring, trilling, 
          hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing. By contrast, 
          feral cats are generally silent.
        </p>
            
        <p>The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature 
          that is clearly responsible for the sound. However, felids of the Panthera genus 
          (tiger, lion, jaguar and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when 
          exhaling.
        </p>
              
        <p>Do cats always land on their feet? Not always, but they have better balance 
          than most animals. When cats spread out their back and front legs they fall more slowly, 
          because their bodies act as a parachute. The tail can also help balance a cat.
        </p>
                
        <p>The first cat in space was a French cat named Felicette (a.k.a. “Astrocat”) In 1963, 
          France blasted the cat into outer space. Electrodes implanted in her brains sent 
          neurological signals back to Earth. She survived the trip.

        <p>The earliest ancestor of the modern cat lived about 30 million years ago. Scientists 
          called it the Proailurus, which means “first cat” in Greek. The group of animals that
          pet cats belong to emerged around 12 million years ago.

        <p>Cats hate the water because their fur does not insulate well when it’s wet. The ∏
          Turkish Van, however, is one cat that likes swimming. Bred in central Asia, its coat 
          has a unique texture that makes it water resistant.
